# CS-8395-Project3

This project is a shooting game in Augment Reality. In this game, user can use their phone camera to shoot the virtual object. I plan to use Unity3D with vuforia as the development environment. The target will be several 3D plane models. The user uses the camera to control the direction and orientation of their plane to shoot the target. The target planes will spawn in the camera's view with random world coordinates. I also plan to add movements to the target so that the game will be more enjoyable. The target will move in a limited area to avoid the user's fire.
